            Yahoo, a very popular internet browser in the early internet days, starts itâ€™s run in second place with 36
            million page views. Yahoo overtakes Aol and becomes the most visited site in april of 2001. Yahoo was
            overtaken by Google in June of 2006 putting Yahoo back in second place. Yahoo reclaims its first place spot
            shortly and proceeds to fall down to seventh place where it ends its run with almost 3.5 billion page views.

            Facebook, a very popular social media network, joined the leaderboard in june of 2007 with a little over 600
            million pageviews a month. In a little less then a year facebook tripled its monthly pageviews and became
            the third most viewed website behind google and yahoo. Youtube overtakes facebook for the first time in
            august of 2010 and later goes into a heated battle with each other over second and third place behind
            google. Facebook ends its run in third place with over 23 billion page views a month.
